# DESCRIPTION

  Tuizins_Piano is a windows buzzer music player in fully c++, with this project you can create musics(you need to know some music theory)
and play musics that have been already created! 

  This is possible because windows have a function named beep, that activates buzzer sound, and you can modulate that sound, change the frequency and tempo.
Beep(frequency,tempo).

  So with that and music theory, you can create an entire music \o/

# TUTORIAL
  This is a College project, so to meet the requisites i need to add a few more steps in the program
